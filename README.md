This is (an extremely rough replica of) the Steam Store webpage that is
accessible at http://store.steampowered.com/

In this project, I:
	- Applied CSS to elements on a page in different ways (class, id, inline)
	- Used CSS Flowbox and grids to organize different elements on the webpage
	- Made menu text glow white when moused over using the hover CSS attribute
	- Derived font-families, background colors, and images from a webpage using my browser's element inspector/editor
	- Made images and divs react to window resizing in a responsive way
